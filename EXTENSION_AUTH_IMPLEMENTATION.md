# Extension Authentication Flow Implementation

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

### Extension Side (apps/extension/)

1. **LoginPage.tsx** - Modified to show single "Log in" button that opens login window
2. **AuthContext.tsx** - Updated to:
   - Open login window to `https://www.zyven.online/login`
   - Listen for `AUTH_SUCCESS` messages from login window
   - Store user data and token in `chrome.storage.local`
   - Manage window lifecycle (monitor closure)

### Web App Side (apps/web/)

1. **extension-callback.tsx** - New route that:
   - Gets current session from Better Auth
   - Sends `AUTH_SUCCESS` message to extension via `window.postMessage`
   - Handles window closure after successful communication
2. **login.tsx** - Modified to:
   - Detect if opened by extension (checks `window.opener` and `window.name`)
   - Redirect to `/extension-callback` after successful OAuth when in extension context
   - Use appropriate callback URLs for OAuth providers
3. **routeTree.gen.ts** - Updated to include `/extension-callback` route

## üîÑ Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "Log in" in extension popup
2. Extension opens `https://www.zyven.online/login` in popup window
3. User completes OAuth (Google/GitHub) on web app
4. Web app redirects to `/extension-callback` page
5. Extension callback page sends message to extension:
   ```javascript
   {
     type: "AUTH_SUCCESS",
     user: { id, name, email, avatar, provider },
     token: "auth-token"
   }
   ```
6. Extension receives message, stores data, and closes login window
7. Extension uses stored token for future API requests

## üöÄ Ready to Test

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. The extension will now:

- Open the web login page in a popup
- Capture authentication data via postMessage
- Store credentials locally
- Use stored token for API authentication

## üìù Notes

- The extension expects the web app to be running at `https://www.zyven.online`
- The token format may need adjustment based on your Better Auth implementation
- The extension callback page includes error handling and user feedback
- Window management ensures proper cleanup after authentication
